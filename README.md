# aimez

aimez is an applied research initiative investigating coherence in complex information environments.

Many of the phenomena of interest manifest as dynamical systems, where small changes in structure or scale can lead to qualitative shifts in behavior.

The aim is to characterize conditions under which structural descriptions remain coherent across variation in scale and environment.

Coherence across variation is reflected in properties such as:
• Explanatory structure that does not collapse before observable behavior changes.
• Safety margins that remain interpretable as conditions evolve.
• System effects that remain attributable across scales.
• Attribution that remains traceable prior to error manifestation.
• Decision persistence that remains stable prior to regime change.

The long-term objective is to understand how coherence is preserved or lost as underlying descriptions vary.

## Current work

• Developing methods for characterizing coherence boundaries in multi-agent information flows.
• Building DecisionDB, an experimental structure for tracking decision provenance.
