      <p>aimez is an applied research initiative investigating coherence in complex information environments.</p>
      
      <p>Many of the phenomena of interest manifest as dynamical systems, where small changes in structure or scale can lead to qualitative shifts in behavior.</p>
      
      <p>The aim is to characterize conditions under which structural descriptions remain coherent across variation in scale and environment.</p>
      
      <p>Coherence across variation is reflected in properties such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explanatory structure that does not collapse before observable behavior changes.</li>
        <li>Safety margins that remain interpretable as conditions evolve.</li>
        <li>System effects that remain attributable across scales.</li>
        <li>Attribution that remains traceable prior to error manifestation.</li>
        <li>Decision persistence that remains stable prior to regime change.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The long-term objective is to understand how coherence is preserved or lost as underlying descriptions vary.</p>
