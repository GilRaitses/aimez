  <h1>Project note</h1>
  
  <p>aimez investigates coherence in complex information environments. Many phenomena of interest behave as dynamical systems, where small changes in structure or scale can lead to qualitative shifts in behavior.</p>
  
  <p>The work focuses on characterizing conditions under which structural descriptions remain coherent across variation in scale and environment.</p>
  
  <p>Properties of interest include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explanatory structure that does not collapse before observable behavior changes.</li>
    <li>Safety margins that remain interpretable as conditions evolve.</li>
    <li>System effects that remain attributable across scales.</li>
    <li>Attribution that remains traceable prior to error manifestation.</li>
    <li>Decision persistence that remains stable prior to regime change.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The long-term objective is to understand how coherence is preserved or lost as underlying descriptions vary.</p>
